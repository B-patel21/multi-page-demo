    <h3>Habitat</h3>

    <p>
      Liveing mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest
      China lives one of the world's rarest mammals: the giant panda, also
      called the panda.

    <h3>Diet</h3>

    <p>
      Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they
      eat other vegetation, fish, or small mammals, but bamboo accounts for 99
      percent of their diets.Pandas eat fast, they eat a lot, and they spend
      about 12 hours a day eating.The reason is that they digest only about a
      fifth of what they eat. Overall, bamboo is not very nutritious. To stay
      healthy, they have to eat a lot—up to 15 percent of their body weight in
      12 hours—so they eat fast.

      The shape of the teeth helps the animals crush the bamboo shoots, leaves,
      and stems that they eat. They can chomp on bamboo up to one-and-a-half
      inches thick. To get the bamboo to their mouths, they hold the stems with
      their front paws, which have enlarged wrist bones that act as thumbs for
      gripping. An adult female panda weighs 200 pounds. Pandas can climb as
      high as 13,000 feet and are also very good swimmers. Sometimes male pandas
      relax by doing handstands against trees.Pandas are shy; they don't venture
      into areas where people live.

    <h3>Threats and Why They Matter</h3>
    <p>
      China’s Yangtze Basin region holds the panda’s primary habitat.
      Infrastructure development (such as dams, roads, and railways) is
      increasingly dividing and isolating panda populations, preventing pandas
      from finding new bamboo forests and potential mates.Forest loss also
      reduces pandas’ access to the bamboo they need to survive. The giant panda
      is an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on
      many other species where they live. In other words, when we protect
      pandas, we invariably protect other animals that live around them, such as
      multicolored pheasants, the golden monkey, takin, and crested ibis.
